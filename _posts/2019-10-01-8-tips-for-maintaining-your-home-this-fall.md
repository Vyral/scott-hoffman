*Make sure your home is ready for winter by following these eight simple tips for fall maintenance.*

The fall season is here at last, which means there are a few fall-related items you’ll want to keep an eye on around the house. As a homeowner, you should make sure to:

**1\. Care for trees and shrubs:** Get rid of dead branches and broken limbs so your tree will blossom again in the spring.

**2\. Rake your leaves:** If you let them build up and clump together throughout fall and winter, you’ll find a lot of dead grass come springtime.

**3\. Check the exterior of your home:** Make sure gutters and downspouts are unclogged, check the foundation and windows, and keep an eye out for wood rot.

**4\. Address gaps you find around vents or crawl spaces:** These are spots where creatures can come in and hang out for the winter. This is something you do not want.

**5\. Check the safety of decks, porches, and driveways:** When winter comes along, ice and snow are inevitable. You want to make sure everything is as safe as possible for your family and neighbors.

**6\. Disconnect exterior house pipes:** You don’t want these to freeze up, break, and cause a leak in your home.&nbsp;

**7\. Check items inside the home:** Look at the weatherstripping on your windows — properly weatherstripped windows lower your utility bills by keeping warm air in and cool air out. In addition, test safety devices such as smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. This is also a good time to deep clean your home, as you’ll be spending more time indoors during the winter.

**8\. Check the chimney:** If you have a fireplace and expect to cozy up next to a fire, make sure your chimney is in good working order.
