Today we'll talk about what the statuses you see on listings sites mean. When you're searching for homes online or having homes sent to you by your agent, you've probably noticed several different statuses. As you've previewed homes, the most common status is the **“active”** status which means it is available for purchase and showings.

Another common status you'll see is **“coming soon.”** A coming soon status means the property is soon to be listed for sale to the market. In most situations, you can make a site-unseen offer, but typically, you cannot look at any property in a coming soon status in advance.

**“Contingent”** is another status you will see. In the past, this typically meant the home was under contract and subject to the sale of another home. In our MLS system, it means a home is under contract and in the due diligence phase of the contract. Once the buyer completes the due diligence period, the home should be changed to **“pending”** to signify completion of the due diligence period.

The final status you'll see is **“off-market.”** This means the property is not currently available for sale.
