<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s what makes up your credit score and how it can either hurt or help you.</em></p>

There are five key components that determine your overall credit score or rating. Here’s a rundown on each of them and how they can hurt or help your score:

**1\. Payment history.** This composes 35% of your score and reflects whether you have made payments on time or not. Missing payments or late payments will harm this part of your score.

**2\. Credit utilization.** This is 30% of your score. It’s a measure of the amount owed in relation to the amount available. A person might have a $4,000 outstanding balance on a $20,000 limit. This would be considered acceptable at a 20% ratio. Owing $15,000 on a $20,000 balance would be a 75% ratio and negatively affect this part of your score.

**3\. Length of credit**

**4\. New credit**

**5\. Type of credit**

The combination of all five areas makes up your total score which lenders use to determine creditworthiness. The best place to get your credit score if you’re planning on buying a home is from a trusted mortgage professional. They can suggest ways to improve your score and make sure you’re protected when making one of the largest investments in your life.
