Today I’m introducing our newest team member, Brad Kleman. **You’ll be seeing a lot of him\!** Brad grew up on the Outer Banks and began his career in the golf industry, then went into retail management for about 10 years before getting into the real estate business.&nbsp;

Brad can offer a five-star customer experience to our clients because he grew up around here and knows the area very well. His background in customer service, retail, and experience with trying to make clients as happy as possible will serve our team greatly. He goes the extra mile and tries to get our clients the best value possible. **We’re thrilled to have him join our team** and look forward to having him serve our clients for years to come.

We’d love to hear your ideas for future blog topics. Reach out to us via phone or email if you have an idea or want to ask any real estate questions. We’d love to help you.
