It’s been one of the wildest years of all of our lives, but today I want to give you a quick update on what the Wake County real estate market is currently doing. The numbers might surprise you.

We had 13,739 new listings in 2019, and that number dropped to 12,700 units so far in 2020. **This isn’t surprising,** given people’s fear of putting their homes on the market during a global pandemic.

As for closed sales, we had 10,319 at this time last year, and we have 10,193 units so far in 2020. This is down just 1.2%. The average sale price has actually risen 4.7% to $371,803.

**The percentage of list price has remained flat from 2019 at 98.5%, indicating that we’re still in a strong seller’s market.** The average days on market remained flat at 28 days as well.

As you can see, the Wake County market is still humming along strongly even during crazy times. If you have any questions for me about the market or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
