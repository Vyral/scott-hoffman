<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are three main tips you need to remember when purchasing homeowners insurance.</em></p>

If you’re getting ready to purchase homeowners insurance, here are three important tips to remember, as advised by Nick Nance of Farm Bureau Insurance:

**1\. Buy locally.** One of Nick’s biggest referral sources is clients who’ve had a bad experience by buying insurance online from an agent they’ve never met before. Buy insurance from someone you can meet face to face and talk with.&nbsp;

**2\. Buy from an agent/company with a good history.** If you don’t factor in a company’s history, you’re just buying based on price, which you don’t want to do. You also want to buy based on quality.&nbsp;

**3\. Don’t wait until the last second to buy.** Buying in a time crunch leaves you no time to research a company’s pricing or history—you’ll likely just pick something so you can close on your loan. Buying a home is a huge financial decision, so give yourself some time to do your due diligence before you buy. Typically, buyers who wait until the last second to buy do so online, which, again, leads to terrible service. The person at the other end of a 1-800 number has no relationship with you and doesn’t really care about you.&nbsp;
