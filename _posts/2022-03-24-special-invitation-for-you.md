Some of our favorite annual events are our Pullen Park get-togethers. We hold one in the spring and summer, and the spring edition for 2022 is coming up.&nbsp;

Join us at Pullen Park shelter \#3 on April 23 from Noon to 2 p.m. We’ll have Smithfield's Chicken 'N Bar-B-Q, free giveaways, and lots of fun. **You can RSVP**[**here**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/pullen2022){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**.**

Pullen Park is located at 520 Ashe Ave in Raleigh. If you have any questions about the event or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
