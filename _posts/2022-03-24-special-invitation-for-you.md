Some of our favorite annual events are our Pullen Park get-togethers. We hold one in the spring and summer, and the spring edition for 2022 is coming up.&nbsp;

Join us at Pullen Park shelter \#3 on April 23 from noon to 2 p.m. We’ll have Smithfield's Chicken 'N Bar-B-Q, free giveaways, and lots of fun. Pullen Park is located at 520 Ashe Ave in Raleigh.&nbsp;**You can RSVP&nbsp;**[**here**](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/pullen2022){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**.**

If you have any questions about the event or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
