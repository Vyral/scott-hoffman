<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why the Raleigh market isn’t seasonal like so many others.</em></p>

I get questions about the real estate market all the time. The one I’ve been hearing most lately is, “It’s getting late in the year, should I just wait until next February to list my home for sale?”

The answer is a resounding NO because Raleigh is not a seasonal market. There are three reasons why:

**1\. Strong long-term projections.** This means there is going to be a constant influx of people because businesses are growing, more jobs are coming here, and it makes for a great climate for the real estate industry.

**2\. Companies are relocating people.** They're not just doing it on January 1, either. They're moving people here year-round to fill their demand for jobs. This means the market will be steady and you won’t see the typical peaks and valleys of a seasonal market.

**3\. School systems.** North Carolina has very diverse options when it comes to schools. There are public schools, private schools, charter schools, and learn-at-home options. This makes people less concerned about moving because there are so many options out there for kids in North Carolina.

If you have any questions for me about the Raleigh market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
