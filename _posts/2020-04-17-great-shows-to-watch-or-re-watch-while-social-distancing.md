Instead of talking about real estate today, I want to share a list of my favorite t.v. shows that you can binge-watch and use to escape a little bit during this hectic time. My all-time favorite show is The Sopranos on HBO. I absolutely loved Dallas growing up, too. Do you remember where you were when J.R. got shot? To hear my full list of great t.v. shows that you can binge-watch during quarantine, watch this short video above.
