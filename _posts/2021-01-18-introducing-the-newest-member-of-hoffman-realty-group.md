<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Spencer Walker is a recent college grad and the newest member of our team.</em></p>

I’d like to introduce all of you to our newest team member, Spencer Walker, who is joining me in today’s video. Spencer is from Hillsborough and a recent college grad who has just joined our team. His grandmother worked in real estate while he was growing up, and the business really piqued his interest from there. His philosophy is that honesty means everything and he treats all his clients like friends and family so he knows they’re taken care of. With his help, we’re going to be able to serve you all even better. To meet Spencer yourself, watch the short video above.
