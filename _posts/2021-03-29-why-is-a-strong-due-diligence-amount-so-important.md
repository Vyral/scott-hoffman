A great way to become a better buyer in this environment is to have a strong due diligence amount in your offer.&nbsp;

**This shows sellers that you have skin in the game, and that the likelihood of you completing the transaction is much higher than a competing offer** with a smaller due diligence amount. It also gives them the peace of mind they need to proceed with the next steps of their moving process.&nbsp;

Your due diligence amount will vary depending on how long the home has been on the market, whether or not you’re competing against other offers, and your ability to submit a due diligence amount that’s high enough to make your offer competitive in the first place. While the due diligence amount isn’t the only variable to consider in your offer, it is an important one in terms of helping it get accepted.&nbsp;
