As a Realtor, I’ve helped hundreds of families find the right home. And among all the steps buyers must follow when purchasing a home, one of the most important is to order a home inspection.&nbsp;

There are several reasons why home inspections are so crucial to the real estate process.&nbsp;

**First, home inspections will alert you to any structural, mechanical, or safety-related issues present in the property.** Many major issues aren’t apparent at a glance. Even homes that appear flawless can have significant problems.&nbsp;

A professional home inspector will be able to identify and record these issues, and once they’re finished with their inspection, will provide you with a comprehensive report on the property’s condition.&nbsp;

Then, after you’ve received this report, your agent will put together a document with a list of repairs you would like the seller to complete before closing.&nbsp;

**You may also choose to have the inspector re-inspect the property after these repairs have been completed.**

Above all, home inspections matter because they help you to understand exactly what you’re buying. A home purchase is not an investment you should take lightly.&nbsp;
