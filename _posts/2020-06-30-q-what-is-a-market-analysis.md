<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A market analysis can help determine the value of your home.</em></p>

What is a market analysis? This is when a real estate agent helps you determine the market value of your home. They’ll come to your house, take a look at its features, then work on the numbers. While it’s not an appraisal, it does give you **a reference point for ascertaining the price at which you should list your property.&nbsp;**

A market analysis takes into account the active, closed, pending, and under contract properties based on sales from the past 12 months. The agent then adjusts the value based on your home’s features. For example, we’ll pull a range of houses sold that share your home’s square footage, lot size, year built, and key features.&nbsp;

After we make adjustments and analyze the numbers, we can determine market value, average days on market, average price per square foot, and how much you can expect to get when your property sells. We also consider the active properties so you can see how your competition stacks up.

**If you’re interested in having a market analysis done on your home, please let us know.** There’s no obligation. Also, call us at (919) 740-0379 or email us if you have any questions. We’d love to be of service.
