<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don’t ruin your home sale before it even begins. Here are six dumb reasons that homes typically fail to sell.</em></p>

I hear all the time from clients about why homes don’t sell, so I wanted to share six such reasons with you today that stick out to me:

**1\. Sellers want to price a home based on feelings instead of market data.** If you’re selling your home, it’s important to follow your agent’s advice. They’ll review with you what they think you can get for your home and where it should reasonably appraise. It’s so important to do this when pricing your home.

**2\. Keeping all of your stuff in your house.** Buyers want to see open spaces. They want to see what you saw when you bought the home. That’s why it’s important to declutter and remove anything from the home that isn’t completely necessary.

**3\. Not sprucing up the house.** If you need new paint or carpet, get that taken care of before you list. A good agent can help you get creative with solutions to help you accomplish these goals.

**4\. Lackluster photos.** If you have an agent who uses smartphone pictures instead of professional photos, please find another agent. Your agent should be properly marketing your home with professional photography to help it sell quicker and for more money.

**5\. Inflexibility with showtimes.** You’re selling a home, which is a consumer product. You need to have hours of operation just like a store. Maybe you should consider having your pets stay somewhere else while you’re showing the home to make it easier. Buyers will look at homes anywhere from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on the weekends. It’s important to be as flexible as possible.

**6\. Lowball offers.** A lowball offer is not the final offer. Don’t just simply reject this kind of offer. Make a counteroffer, don’t get offended, and be patient.

If you have any questions for me about this list or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
