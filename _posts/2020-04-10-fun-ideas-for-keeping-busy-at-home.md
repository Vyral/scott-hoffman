As I’m sure you’ve figured out by now, being stuck at home can be a little boring, so I’m passing along some fun ideas for spending all this time at home. Why not take advantage of really cool technologies like Facebook and Zoom to keep in touch with loved ones and friends? Perhaps you could use the calming touch of Mother Nature; so long as you abide by distancing guidelines, you can certainly go for a walk and enjoy the outdoors. They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, but have you tried lately? Spend some genuine time with a four-legged friend. To learn some more neat ways to stay occupied in a world on pause, watch the video above.&nbsp;
