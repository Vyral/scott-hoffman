Though many of my friends will get a kick out of me covering this topic (I tend to be very particular about how homes are arranged), today I want to share a few great tips about keeping a minimalistic home, most of which I practice myself.

**1\. Sort through the mail as soon as it comes in.** Toss any mail you don’t need into the recycle bin immediately; don’t let junk mail clutter up your home.

**2\. Wash your dishes after using them.** Don’t let dirty dishes pile up on your sinks and counters; it’ll make your life easier if you just wash them immediately after using them.

**3\. Clear off the countertops every night.** Do this each night before you go to bed. It’ll keep your house clean and clear, and you’ll feel better about your day if you start it with an organized home.

**4\. Be strict about what you allow into your home.** If family members are trying to give you stuff that they don’t want in their homes, chances are that you don’t need it in yours, either. Before you accept that stuff from friends and family, make sure you love it; take 24 hours to think about it and see if it’s something that you want to take up your home’s precious space.

**5\. Declutter your small spaces daily.** Most of us have some drawers or space in our home where random items tend to gather—we call ours a ‘treasure drawer,’ but others might call it a ‘junk drawer,’ too. Take the time to clear out these areas. This year, I actually took 50 bags of clothes out of my closet\!

If you have any questions or suggestions of your own about minimalistic housekeeping, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. We’d love to hear your questions and ideas.
