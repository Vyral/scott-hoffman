No two homes are alike, so how do you determine what a home is worth? This is where competitive market analyses come in, and we’d like to explain them to you today.&nbsp;

**A CMA is a side-by-side comparison of homes for sale and homes that have recently been sold.** This process takes many important details into account such as neighborhood, neighbors, baths, lot size, and any unique feature of your home. The purpose is to find a reasonable market value based on what’s happening in your local market.&nbsp;

To do a CMA, agents take a look at tons of data about your area, and much of it comes from the MLS. This is a list of homes that only agents, appraisers, and other real estate professionals have access to. It contains the most accurate and up-to-date information possible, so you know the data is good.&nbsp;

This leads us to the big question: **How accurate is a CMA?** Using the available data, a CMA is the best way to find the current value of your home. The only issue is that the market is constantly changing. The number you get from a CMA could be as accurate as possible, but it only takes a few new homes in your area to change the math overnight. Also, a CMA is reliant on the skills and experience of the agent performing it. If your agent is inexperienced, your value could be off.&nbsp;

Today, instant home valuations are increasingly popular, and it’s easy to see why. They’re incredibly convenient, but they should only be considered benchmarks. Whatever algorithm a website uses to evaluate your home will never take into consideration all the necessary data. **That’s why most agents recommend receiving a CMA to get a truly accurate home value.** Many agents will even do one for you for free\!&nbsp;

If you are considering making a move in the new year, or if you have any other questions, please reach out to my team via phone or email. We’d love to help\!&nbsp;
