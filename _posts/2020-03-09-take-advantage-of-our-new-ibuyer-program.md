<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Keller Offers is our version of an iBuyer program that allows you to sell your home without the hassle of the market.</em></p>

At Keller Williams, we recently rolled out something to help our consumers: **Keller Offers powered by Offerpad.**

Under this program, we’ll come out to seller’s homes and show them what they could get for their property if they went through the Keller Offers program versus the traditional form of selling on the market.&nbsp;

The advantage our program provides to you, the consumer, is that **you get to see how much you’d net from your home sale no matter which route you decided to go,** which, in turn, allows you to make more educated decisions. At your request, we can even go submit your home to Opendoor to get a quote from them, for comparison’s sake.

Often, when people see the offers placed side by side, they understand that listing their home in the traditional way, though it might be inconvenient and slower, is often the more reliable way to go. That’s why they choose the traditional route about 90% of the time—they’re not going to lose 15% of their home’s value to pay for convenience.

If you would like to learn more about iBuyers and points to keep in mind about them before you decide to sell your home to one, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.
