<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m sharing how to succeed in what you want by setting SMART goals.</em></p>

Today we’re going to discuss New Year’s resolutions. It’s customary to pick things we’d like to accomplish by the end of the year, but oftentimes a few weeks into the year we fail miserably at it. We fail because we don’t set ourselves up for success in achieving those goals. To reach these goals, they need to be SMART goals.&nbsp;

SMART goals have five key elements:

**S- Specific.** For example, you want to be faster, better, or increase something definitive. You don’t want vague objectives. Saying, “I want to lose weight” isn’t well-defined enough.&nbsp;

**M- Measurable.** How do you know if you’re succeeding? What measure are you using to determine success? You need to know whether you’re making progress.&nbsp;

**A- Attainable.** If you set a goal you can’t accomplish, what’s the point? You can break up a larger objective into smaller pieces that are easier to achieve.

**R- Realistic.** This has to be something you can accomplish in your life, a feasible change. You need to be able to attain growth in your goal.&nbsp;

**T- Timed.** For example, “I’m going to lose 30 pounds by the end of April.” An easier way to do this is to ground yourself in why you want to reach this objective: “I’m going to lose 30 pounds by the end of April so I can enjoy better health.”&nbsp;
