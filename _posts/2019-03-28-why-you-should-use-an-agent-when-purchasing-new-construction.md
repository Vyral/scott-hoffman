When purchasing new construction, having a buyer’s agent working on your behalf is critical.&nbsp;

The on-site agent may be perfectly knowledgeable, but it’s important to realize that they don’t have your best interests in mind. **Having a Realtor to represent your wants, needs, and goals is, therefore, key.&nbsp;**

One of the most common complaints buyers raise about new construction homes is that they’re often completed after the agreed-upon time frame. When you work with an agent, they can help to ensure that issues like this are addressed and resolved as effectively as possible. **A quality agent will also be able to help you choose the right builder to work with**, so that the likelihood of these issues coming up is reduced from the start.&nbsp;

Usually, the process of selecting a builder will involve narrowing your search to between two to three different builders with strong reputations, and then touring a few of the models they offer. During these tours, your agent will help you assess homes with your goals (and the property’s resale value) in mind. Agents can also negotiate the inclusion of a few upgrades, like switching out tile for laminate flooring in the bathroom, for example.

**Even after you select the perfect home, your agent can continue to be a resource** through the remainder of the process by attending the pre-construction walkthrough, guiding you through the inspection process, and helping you to interpret paperwork. The bottom line is this: If you’re thinking of buying new construction, you need to have an agent working on your behalf.&nbsp;
