This is the craziest seller’s market I’ve seen in my 26 years of doing business. If you’re planning to buy a home, you need to know how to make your offer appeal to the seller so that you have a better chance of getting yours accepted. There are a few basic and more innovative strategies you can try in order to catch a seller’s eye:

**1\. Offer a price above the listing price.** Sellers want to see a strong, nonrefundable due-diligence deposit, which shows that you’re serious about buying the home since you have more skin in the game.

**2\. Have the money to pay the difference between the sale price and the appraised value.** In a seller’s market, it’s unlikely that the seller would be willing to reduce their asking price to the appraised value of the home if the appraisal comes in low; most homes are selling for more than their appraised values.&nbsp;

**3\. Have a strong proof-of-funds letter if you’re using cash.** If you’re getting financing from a lender, then get a strong pre-approval letter that says your lender has pulled and reviewed your credit.

**4\. Have your lender call and assure the seller you’re a strong buyer.&nbsp;**

**5\. Offer a rent-back to the seller.** With the shortage of inventory, sellers are also having a tough time finding other homes to buy. By allowing them to stay in the house after you close, you’d give them extra time to find and close on a house of their own.

**6\. Offer to pay for the seller’s moving or closing costs.**
