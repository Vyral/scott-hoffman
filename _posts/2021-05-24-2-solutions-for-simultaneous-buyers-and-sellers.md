It’s a common problem in today’s market: Homeowners are eager to sell, but they’re concerned about what comes next because the home-buying market is so competitive. Today I have two way to deal with this situation that might be helpful to you:

**1\. Speak with a lender and try to qualify to buy your new home without selling.** This would allow you to be much more competitive as a homebuyer while also giving you the peace of mind that you won’t be left homeless.

**2\. Put your home on the market and negotiate a rent-back agreement.** Sellers can call their shots in this market, and you have a good chance to negotiate an agreement to let you stay in your home after it's sold while you search for a new property.

Both of these options have helped a ton of homeowners find solutions in this market.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us about your specific situation, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
