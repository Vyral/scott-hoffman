I’ve been hearing from a lot of clients who want to buy and sell, but they’re concerned about how the process will work during this time when everyone is staying home. We’ve put some great things in place for buyers and sellers to be able to buy and sell from home as well. We’re offering buyer consultations via Zoom, virtual showings for sellers via FaceTime, and even holding virtual open houses. In-person showings are being kept to a small circle and all health and safety precautions are being taken.
