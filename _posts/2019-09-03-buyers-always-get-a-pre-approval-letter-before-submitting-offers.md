If you’re in the market for your next home, there’s one very critical step you need to take before you start submitting offers. Before you do anything else, you must get a pre-approval letter or proof of funds letter. Neglecting to do so could cost you your dream home.&nbsp;

Thankfully, the process of obtaining this document is quite simple. **All you need to do is visit a lender, fill out a loan application, and provide them with the necessary documents.** After this point, the lender will determine what kind of home you can afford and will issue a pre-approval letter. This letter essentially verifies that you’re qualified to move forward with a home purchase.

When sellers receive an offer, one of the first things they’ll check for is whether or not a pre-approval letter has been included. The presence of this letter will ultimately provide them with the peace of mind they need to feel confident in your ability to close. **Sellers tend to see offers that come without a pre-approval letter as a major red flag.&nbsp;**

The bottom line is that having a pre-approval letter or proof of funds letter could make or break your ability to strike a deal on your dream home.&nbsp;
