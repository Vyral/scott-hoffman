I’ve been in the real estate industry for the last 26 years, and one of the most important things a homebuyer can do is get a home inspection before buying a property. Here are the four reasons why it’s critical to get a home inspection on any home you’re buying:

**1\. Learn about the home.** This is a huge investment, so you want to know as much as possible before you finalize the purchase.

**2\. Learn how to care for your home.** Inspectors give loads of tips on how to care for your home and keep up its maintenance so you don’t have as many future repairs.

**3\. Discover needed repairs.** While the seller may make some repairs, you will be responsible for what they don’t fix. To keep your investment solid, you want to make sure you can afford any repairs the seller isn’t willing to do.

**4\. Peace of mind.** Due diligence tasks like a home inspection tell you exactly what you’re buying so there are no surprises.

If you have questions about home inspections, buying a home, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
