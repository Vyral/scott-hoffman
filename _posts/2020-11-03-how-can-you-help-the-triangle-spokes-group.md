<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Let’s help the Triangle Spokes Group give back to families in need.</em></p>

The season of giving is upon us, and with that in mind, I want to introduce you to a local charity that’s well worth your time and attention: the Triangle Spokes Group.&nbsp;

This charity is a nonprofit founded and run by Ashley Wilson and Jenn Nowalk, two very good friends of mine. **It distributes new bicycles and helmets to less fortunate families during the holiday season.** 100% of their proceeds go directly to the bikes and the children, and they partner with the Salvation Army of Wake County to distribute the bikes in time for the holiday season.&nbsp;

This year, their goal is to donate over 500 bikes to Wake County families, and the Salvation Army predicts that over 4,000 families and over 9,000 children will come to them to seek help. They’re servicing a high demand, and they need our help to make this dream happen.&nbsp;

For generations, children have wanted to wake up on Christmas morning to find a new, shiny bike, and it’s the Triangle Spokes Group’s goal to continue this tradition and make their days brighter—especially on Christmas day.&nbsp;
