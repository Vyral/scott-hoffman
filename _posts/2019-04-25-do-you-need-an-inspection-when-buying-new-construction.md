If you’re buying a new construction home, you may be curious as to whether it’s necessary to order an inspection. After all, the home should be in perfect condition if it’s brand new, right? Not necessarily. **Inspections are still necessary when purchasing new construction**, and there are a few reasons why.

The key difference between the inspection process for a resale home purchase compared to a new construction home purchase is timing. Builders are often making adjustments to the property right up until closing, so ordering an inspection too early in a new construction purchase leads to certain issues being overlooked.

Because of this, however, **some builders do offer a 12-month home warranty****.** If this is the case during your purchase, you may want to delay your inspection until after closing. By living in the home for a while, you’ll gain a better understanding of what may be wrong with it, which will allow you to guide the inspector toward any problem areas you’ve identified.
