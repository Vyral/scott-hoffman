<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m sharing the differences between goal- and growth-conscious people. Which do you want to be?</em></p>

Today I’m sharing the differences between goal-conscious and growth-conscious people. Which do you want to be?

**Goal-conscious people:**

* Are focused on the destination
* Motivate you and others
* Feel everything is seasonal
* Challenge you
* Stop when the goal is reached
* Wait for growth to come
* Learn only from mistakes
* Depend on good luck

**Growth-conscious people:&nbsp;**

* Focus on the journey
* Help you and others mature
* See things as life-long experiences
* Change you
* Keep growing beyond the goal
* Take responsibility to actively grow
* Learn before making mistakes
* Depend on hard work

This is an interesting way to look at these two types of people. My goal is to always be a growth-conscious person. Keep these differences in mind when going about your daily life.
