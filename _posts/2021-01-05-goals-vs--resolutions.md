<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why you should set goals instead of resolutions.</em></p>

We’re officially into 2021, which means many of us have made resolutions such as losing weight, quitting smoking, etc. This, however, is the wrong way to do it. **You should be setting goals, not resolutions.** With resolutions, there are no consequences if you don’t achieve them. They’re merely things you wish would happen, and wishing doesn’t work nearly as well as being purposeful in life.&nbsp;

How do you set a proper goal? **A goal needs to be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and come with a level of accountability.** For example, let’s say you want to lose 20 pounds by April 15. This is specific and measurable because you set a time frame and identified a number, and it’s relevant because it’s something that’s important to you. It’s also attainable, which means it meets four out of the five goal-setting criteria.&nbsp;

What if you now added a level of accountability? Suppose you say that if you don’t lose 20 pounds by April 15, you have to give away $200 to your least favorite charity. You can insert any consequence you want for not achieving your goal, but the point is that now there’s power behind it. It was already important to you to lose weight, but now there’s a consequence for not doing so. You can use this same principle for any goal you set, whether it's for your business life or personal life.&nbsp;

I hope you have your best year ever in 2021. If you’d like to talk more about how to set proper goals or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you.
