The Hoffman Realty Group is on a search for talent. There’s no one better to reach out to than all of our friends and family who we've helped. **If you know anybody who might be interested in pursuing a career in real estate, please let us know.** Our ideal candidate would be someone motivated, goal-oriented, and with the heart of a servant.

As our way of saying thanks, we'll send you a $100 Amazon gift card for each person we hire that you recommended. If you think of anyone, have them check out [thehoffmanrealtygroup.com](http://thehoffmanrealtygroup.com) and reach out to us.&nbsp;

If you have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to call or email us. We look forward to hearing from you.
