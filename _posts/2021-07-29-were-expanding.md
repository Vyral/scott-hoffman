I have some very exciting news to share today. I’ve been in the real estate business in the Triangle area for 26 years, and I hope to do it for many more. However, **we’re expanding to the Outer Banks area**, so I’ll also be affiliated with a company called Keller Willaims Outer banks Realty. I’m thrilled to offer this to my clients and serve both areas.&nbsp;

The Outer Banks is a beautiful place that I call my second home. We’re eager to help you, your friends, and your family with all your real estate interests in both the Triangle and Outer Banks areas. Please [check out our new Outer Banks website.](https://www.searchobxhomes.com/)

If you have any questions or real estate needs in either area, please give us a call or send an email. Remember, you can also always [visit our Triangle website](https://www.raleighrealestatesearch.com/). We’d love to hear from you and look forward to serving your real estate needs for many years to come.
