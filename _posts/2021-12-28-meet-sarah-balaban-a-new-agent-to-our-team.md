Today we wanted to introduce you to our new team member: Sarah Balaban\! We’re excited to have her on the team, and we wanted her to share a bit about herself.

**Tell us a bit about yourself.**

I was born in Virginia Beach, and I grew up in Johnston County in central North Carolina. I’ve spent most of my life along the coast in Virginia and North Carolina. For the last 10 years, I’ve lived in Kill Devil Hills with my husband and two sons.

**What made you get into** **real estate?**

In the early 2000s, I started working with a development company that built subdivisions in Elizabeth City. I developed a passion for the industry, and eventually went to commercial real estate, then vacation rentals, and ultimately ended up in residential, where I felt I could build the best relationships with my clients.&nbsp;

**Why should a client choose you?**

Well, my clients become like family, and I take care of my family. If there’s ever an issue, I always answer my phone and take care of it.&nbsp;

If you need a great agent in the Outer Banks, please give us a call. We’d love to connect you with Sarah. If you have any other questions or needs, feel free to call us as well. Have a great day\!
