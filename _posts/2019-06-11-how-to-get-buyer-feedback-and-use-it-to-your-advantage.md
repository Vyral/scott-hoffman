What can you do to get feedback on your home and use it to your advantage when it comes time to sell?

It’s simple. After each showing, the agent who shows your home will receive a survey that will capture the buyer’s thoughts about your property. This survey asks five key questions:

**1\. Is the client interested in the home?** This allows us to gauge the market interest in your home.

**2\. How would the buyer rate their overall experience?** Of course, we want the buyer to rate your home as above-average or better because that shows that you’ve done your job of preparing your home and that we’ve done our job of packaging and positioning your listing.

**3\. What is their opinion on the price of the home?** This is important because we don’t want to chase the market or have to respond to it—we want to set the market. We want the survey to tell us that we’ve adequately priced the home, not that we’re overpriced.

**4\. How would they rate the home compared to other homes on the market?** Obviously, we want to see average or better marks here, but if there are any bad marks, it’ll show us that we need to address some staging issues, possibly do some updates, or adjust the price.

**5\. Do you have any recommendations and/or comments about the home?** Here, we’ll sometimes see remarks saying that carpets need to be cleaned or that the home is a little dated. Hopefully, we won’t see too many of those types of comments, since we ought to have addressed those issues. My favorite comment to see is, “This listing is in my buyer’s top three.” If I see that sort of remark, I’ll call up the buyer agent and ask them what it will take to make your listing their buyer’s No. 1 choice.

The biggest thing to remember is that we’re looking for trends in the responses to these five questions—if we’ve done our jobs correctly, we’ll see mostly positive trends instead of negative. Positive feedback shows us that we’ve priced the home correctly, properly staged and prepared the home, and that your listing measures up well against other homes.

If you have any questions about this topic or about selling homes in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you\!
