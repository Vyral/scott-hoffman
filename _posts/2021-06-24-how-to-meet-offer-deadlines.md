Today I’m talking about offer deadlines. What are they and what do they mean?

You’ll often see offered deadlines on listings that say, “We're taking offers up until X date for consideration by the seller.” In many cases, especially in this crazy seller’s market, homes are going on the market for only a couple of days, sometimes not even that long, and they’re selling above list price and with significant non-refundable due diligence deposits.

**Before you take a look at a home, it's important to ask whether there is an offer deadline.** You want to go take a look at a property quickly to meet the offer deadline. You wouldn't want to do it in the last two hours before the offer deadline. You need to give your agent time to write the offer. Time is of the essence and if you see something you like, you better be prepared to jump on it in this market.

If there's any way we can help you with your real estate needs or help you navigate this crazy seller's market, give us a call at 919-740-0379.
