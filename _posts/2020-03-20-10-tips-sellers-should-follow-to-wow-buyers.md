<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s what sellers can do to ensure their home leaves a wonderful first impression on buyers.</em></p>

As a seller, you naturally want to sell your home quickly and for as much money as possible. Following these 10 tips will help you go a long way toward that goal:&nbsp;

**1\. Improve your landscaping.** Look at your home through the eyes of a buyer who’s just driven up to it for the first time; is it welcoming? Is the yard well-kempt, bushes trimmed, and flower beds mulched?

**2\. Clean the outside of your home.** Powerwash the siding, clean the windows, and tackle any easy outdoor repairs. You never get a chance to redo a first impression, so help your home’s exterior make a good one.&nbsp;

**3\. Make those simple repairs.** Address doors that don’t latch, toilets or sinks that leak, or anything else that will almost certainly show up on an inspection report. If you can make a simple fix now, it’s always better to do so than wait until a buyer counts it against you.&nbsp;

**4\. Make the front door inviting.** Give it a fresh coat of paint—you’ll be surprised by how big of a difference this makes from a buyer’s perspective. While you’re at, replace the address numbers near your door if they’re faded or barely visible for some other reason.&nbsp;

**5\. Get a new doormat.** It’s another cheap step that can help buyers visualize how warm and inviting that home can be.&nbsp;

**6\. Remove clutter and depersonalize.** Make your home look like a hotel—minimalistic layout with no personal/sentimental belongings visible. Take personal photos down and rent a storage unit so that you have a place to put items that may be overcrowding a room in your home.&nbsp;

**7\. Organize closets and drawers.** Make sure that at least 25% of your closet is free, open space. This gives the impression that the space inside them is ample, and that the home’s storage areas will be impossible to fill.&nbsp;

**8\. Make surfaces shine.** Have your home professionally detailed (if you need the name of a trustworthy company, please reach out to me). Get into the moldings, the blinds, the ceiling vents—the areas you probably don’t routinely clean.&nbsp;

**9\. Tone down the colors.** If you have a lime green dining room or bathroom, keep in mind that not everybody will enjoy that loud of a color. Opt for neutral colors when you repaint.&nbsp;

**10\. Neutralize odors.** The last thing you want to have is a buyer whose nose is immediately assaulted by pet odors, like a cat’s litter box. If you use air fresheners, though, don’t overdo it; you don’t want to blast buyers with store-bought fragrances to the point that they suspect you’re covering something up. Bake cookies or bread, as it produces that lovely “at home” smell.&nbsp;

As always, reach out to me if you have additional questions about this or any other real estate-related topic. I’m happy to help.&nbsp;
